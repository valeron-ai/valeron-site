# Session: 2026-02-27_1101

**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.6

## Focus
Add a privacy policy page to valeron.ai with route, footer link, and full CCPA-compliant content.

## What Was Done
- Created `/privacy` route via Next.js App Router (`src/app/privacy/page.tsx`)
- Added subtle "Privacy" footer link to the home page (bottom-right of content section)
- Populated privacy page with full CCPA/CPRA-compliant policy from provided .docx
- Fixed formatting issues: removed redundant global CSS reset, bumped typography to `text-base`, added proper header/footer, increased section spacing, widened content area
- Moved `overflow: hidden` from global CSS to home page `<main>` so privacy page can scroll

### Suggested Focus
No outstanding work for the marketing site. Could add additional legal pages (Terms of Service) or refine the privacy page design once reviewed live.

### Key Files
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Home page with privacy footer link
- `src/app/privacy/page.tsx` - Full privacy policy page
- `src/app/globals.css` - Global styles (Tailwind v4 Preflight handles reset)

### Kickoff Message
Privacy page is live at valeron.ai/privacy with full CCPA/CPRA content and a footer link from the home page. The "Last Updated" date is set to Feb 27, 2026. No outstanding issues — check the live deploy to confirm formatting looks good on mobile and desktop.
